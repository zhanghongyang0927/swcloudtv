    // These log methods are called under different circumstances
    // Typically, the circumstances are as follows:
    //  - Debug messages are for tracing the process in detail
    //  - Info messages are for coarse tracing, showing events of interest
    //  - Warning messages are to indicate events that may have undesirable or noticeable (side) effects.
    //  - Error messages are to indicate unrecoverable errors, the calling process needs to abort its current action
    //
    // The parameters file, line and function /may/ be used by the log interface but this is not required.
    // The message is already expanded, if necessary.
