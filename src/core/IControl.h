    ///        The session will be in STATE_CONNECTING until the session is fully set up.
    /// \param [in] host  The remote host URL, e.g. "rfbtv://127.0.0.1:8095".
    /// \param [in] url   The application URL, e.g. "ctvprogram:youtube".
    /// \param [in] screen_width  The width of the client screen in pixels.
    /// \param [in] screen_height The height of the client screen in pixels.
    /// \param [in] optional_parameters A map of key-value pairs that will be added to the session setup message.
    ///
    /// \note This is a non-blocking call. The session is handled in its own thread. Check the actual status with
    ///       the get_state() method. When one or more mandatory properties are not set or an invalid host URL is given
    ///       then the session will not be set up, even though this method initially returns success (true).
    ///
    /// Possible parameter names and their values:
    /// \li "lang" The natural language to use by the UI application. The format is an IETF
    ///            language tag, e.g. "en". If not specified, the application will use a
    ///            default language.
    /// \li "lan"  Type of network connection that the client is using. Valid values are: "wlan",
    ///            "eth", "eth10", "eth100", "eth1000" and "LSC".
    /// \li "fw"   The firmware version running on the device, e.g. "1.3.2.300".
    /// \li "configured_display" Preferred display, typically used to indicate to the
    ///            server that an SD screen is connected. Example value: "pal4x3".
    ///
    /// Please refer to the documentation of the underlying protocol for details.
