/// \brief
/// Client error codes as defined in 'CloudTV Client Error Code Specification' version 1.4
/// OK, I know it's silly to define values using values, but there are no mnemonics defined in
/// the document mentioned above. Furthermore, the error codes have no unique mapping so they
/// can't be assigned a proper name either.
/// At least this way it's easy to find all codes that can be generated.
/// It's possible to use the error codes as proper enum values or as simple integer values.
/// It's up to the client software to decide.
