Description
===========

This example client shows how:
- an RFB-TV session can be established,
- client-side overlays can be implemented,
- the audio/video stream from the platform can be played back on the STB,
- key mappings can be done, and
- certificates can be set for a secure RFB-TV session.

This example serves as a good starting point when porting to a new STB. It has
most basic features that are required to run a CloudTV session.

Please refer to the Porting Guide and other examples for more features.
