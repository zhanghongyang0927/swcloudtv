Description
===========

This example client shows how to implement and register a DRM system with the SDK.

It implements the 'clearkey' mechanism to setup DRM sessions and transfer encryption
keys and it uses AES-128 to decrypt the stream.
The decrypted stream can be forwarded as a clear UDP stream to verify the results.

Please refer to the Porting Guide and other examples for more features.
